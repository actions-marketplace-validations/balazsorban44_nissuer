# Nissuer

A GitHub Action for tried and tired maintainers.

This action is meant to help maintainers of open source projects by automating some of the more tedious/repetitive tasks that come with the job. Make issues non-issues quicker by letting it handle unhelpful issues/comments.

> NOTE: Developers are coming to your project with all sorts of backgrounds/skill levels or understanding of the open source world. Show empathy while using this action. ðŸ’š We recommend adding comments that not only dismiss unhelpful issues/comments, but educate the user on how to be more helpful in the future.
